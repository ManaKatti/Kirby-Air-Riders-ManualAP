# Kirby-Air-Riders-ManualAP
An Archipelago Manual for the Switch 2 title Kirby Air Riders
The goal is to win Vs. Gigantes in stadium mode as Gigantes which is unlocked through gaining keys by completing 
a set amount of courses in Air and Top Ride, as well as defeating two bosses in the Stadium mode of 
City Trial. Beating these bosses and winning on these courses (6 for Top Ride and 12 for Air Ride) 
will unlock Gigantes Keys, which are required to unlock Vs. Gigantes for getting the goal condition.
Unlocked stadiums can either be played standalone or within City Trial (by toggling them on in options).
There are 2 additional checks for each Air Ride/Top Ride course as well as winning on them, as well as
some additional checks for doing certain things during City Trial games (e.g. reaching the garden
in the sky in Skyah). There are some stadium specific goals (e.g. scoring 80 or more points in
Target Flight 2 with Bulk Star or reaching a certain distance in Air Glider).
This manual is best played with a completed save file with all courses/stadiums and characters/vehicles
unlocked. (NOTE: playtesting was done on the British English version of the game so the goals for
Air Glider/High Jump were roughly translated into ft).
