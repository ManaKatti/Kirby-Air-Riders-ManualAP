# Kirby-Air-Riders-ManualAP
An Archipelago Manual for the Switch 2 title Kirby Air Riders
The goal is to win Vs. Gigantes in stadium mode which is unlocked through gaining keys by completing 
a set amount of courses in Air and Top Ride, as well as defeating two bosses in the Stadium mode of 
City Trial. Beating these bosses and winning on these courses (6 for Top Ride and 12 for Air Ride) 
will unlock Gigantes Keys, which are required to unlock Vs. Gigantes for getting the goal condition.
This manual is best played with a completed save file with all courses/stadiums and characters/vehicles
unlocked.
